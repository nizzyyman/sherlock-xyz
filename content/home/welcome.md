# Why Sherlock?

Sherlock is a risk management platform designed to provide DeFi protocols with affordable, reliable coverage against smart contract exploits starting from Day 1.

Sherlock coverage is backed by proprietary staking pools that offer some of the highest risk-adjusted returns in DeFi. This is made possible by our team of security and risk experts who evaluate the smart contracts of every protocol, price the coverage and have skin in the game alongside stakers.

Partnering with Sherlock is the best way to give potential users peace of mind and maximize the likelihood of a successful launch.

Vision stuff

We believe decentralized finance (DeFi) has a unique opportunity to become one of the most impactful societal goods in the 21st century. But it’s not guaranteed.

When we looked at the state of DeFi in 2020, we saw a burgeoning ecosystem with the potential to bring equality of financial access to billions of people. But DeFi was plagued by two pernicious problems: scalability and safety.

While many projects are working to solve the scalability problem, there aren’t many new approaches to making DeFi safer. It’s also clear that no approach is able to prevent 100% of exploits. We’ve decided to focus our efforts on managing the risks around exploits rather than aiming for 100% prevention.

We believe that by improving the safety of DeFi we’ll be able to help bring DeFi to the masses.
