# Sherlock

Our vision

Sherlock is a risk management platform designed to provide protocols with affordable, reliable coverage against smart contract exploits. 

Anyone can stake in our staking pools and we aim to offer the highest risk-adjusted return in DeFi. This is made possible by our expert smart contract security team, who reviews and prices coverage for every protocol we take on and has “skin-in-the-game” alongside our stakers.

<!---
We believe decentralized finance (DeFi) has a unique opportunity to become one of the most impactful societal goods in the 21st century. But it’s not guaranteed.

When we looked at the state of DeFi in 2020, we saw a burgeoning ecosystem with the potential to bring equality of financial access to billions of people. But DeFi was plagued by two pernicious problems: scalability and safety.

While many projects are working to solve the scalability problem, there aren’t many new approaches to making DeFi safer. It’s also clear that no approach is able to prevent 100% of exploits. We’ve decided to focus our efforts on managing the risks around exploits rather than aiming for 100% prevention.

We believe that by improving the safety of DeFi we’ll be able to help bring DeFi to the masses.
