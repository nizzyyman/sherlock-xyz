## Stakers
Coverage is written against the capital provided by stakers. In return for providing capital, stakers get access to one of the highest, sustainable, uncorrelated APYs in all of DeFi. Sherlock was designed to make staking as easy as setting it and forgetting it. Because the security team does all the heavy lifting, stakers simply need to trust the incentives of the security team to know their returns are being maximized.
