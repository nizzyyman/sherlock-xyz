## Protocols
Protocols pay Sherlock a small fee in return for an upfront security assessment and repayment in the event of an exploit. A protocol will indicate how much value they want covered ($1Bn, a specific pool, etc.), and Sherlock will work with each protocol individually to draft a coverage agreement that outlines exactly what types of events/risks they want covered.
